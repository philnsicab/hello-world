# hello-world

Hey I am Phil from France, I love music (piano, mixing, composing, writing lyrics...), sport, programming, and many other things.

I started to develop a VST synthesizer with the Juce library, but as I am not a computer engineer (I am a civil engineer), it is a long trip for me (althought I know HTML, PHP, Javascript). I learned c++, DSP through MOOCs, and I followed the tutorials on the Juce website.

The synth is already working (you can download it on theyeaah's page) but I want to add features to it before releasing it. I have been doing copies on my code on my own computer, it was working perfectly until a point where I felt it was becoming messy because of the number of files and of changes. I hope this will help me keeping things organised while the code is still not to complicated.

I have also lerned how to use dioxygen to document my project to make it easily understandable for me and other people (I am not against some help, so if you want to participate just say hi!).
