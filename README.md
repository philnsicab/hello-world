# hello-world

Hey I am Phil from France, I love music (piano, mixing, composing, writing lyrics...), sport, programming, and many other things.

I started to develop a VST synthesizer with the Juce library, but as I am not a computer engineer (I am a civil engineer), I have had to educate my self a little bit, so I learned c++, DSP through MOOCs, and I followed the tutorials on the Juce website.

Now my synth is already working (you can download it on theyeaah's page) but I want to add features (I want a modular) before releasing it.
When adding features, I have been doing copies on my code on my own computer, it was working perfectly until a point where I felt it was becoming messy because of the number of files and of changes. That's why now I am learning how to use git repositories : I hope this will help me keeping things organised while the code is still not to complicated.

I have also lerned how to use dioxygen to document my project to make it easily understandable for me and other people (I am not against some help, so if you want to participate just say hi!).
