Hey I Phil from France, I love music, sport, programming, and many other things. I am here to learn how to manage the developement process for a soft synth (vst instrument) I am working on. It is a C++ project based on the JUCE library so it will be portable. I also want it free and open source.
The synth is already working but I want to add features to it before releasing it. I have been doing branches on my own, it was working perfectly until a point where I feel that it is becoming messy. I hope this will help me keeping things organised. I am also learning how to use dioxygen to document my project to make it easily understandable for me and other people (I am not against some help).
